      <h2>Our Game</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Dachshund Dash</strong> is a playful twist on the classic snake game. 
        Instead of a snake, you guide an adorable dachshund through a fun adventure, collecting tasty bones along the way! 
        The goal is simple: grow as long as you can without running into yourself or the walls. 
        Designed for both desktop and mobile, this game brings a bit of charm and nostalgia with a modern, light-hearted feel.
      </p>

      <h2>A Short History of Snake Games</h2>
      <p>
        The original Snake game became famous in the late 1970s, first appearing on arcade machines. 
        It gained worldwide popularity in the 1990s when it was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones — almost everyone who owned a Nokia has played it at least once! 
        Simple yet addictive, Snake captured the magic of growing your "tail" and dodging obstacles, creating a timeless formula that inspired countless versions and reimaginings, including Dachshund Dash!
