## User Experience

### Project Goals

The primary goal of Dachshund Dash is to create an engaging and accessible web-based game designed for players aged 5 and above. The game is intended to offer light entertainment, improve concentration and reaction time, and provide a playful experience through a charming dachshund-themed design.
This project also aims to serve as a learning exercise for front-end development techniques, including responsive web design, JavaScript logic for interactive gameplay, and visual asset creation.

Business Objectives:
-	Deliver a game that can offer both casual entertainment and short play sessions — ideal for quick breaks, commutes, or family playtime.
-	Ensure compatibility with both desktop (keyboard-controlled) and mobile (touch-controlled) devices.
-	Design a flexible game flow to accommodate players of varying ages, with planned difficulty levels (Easy / Hard) to broaden appeal.
-	Create a child-safe, visually appealing design using friendly dachshund-themed assets to capture players’ interest.
-	Develop clear, professional documentation to present the project structure and development process to potential employers or collaborators.
